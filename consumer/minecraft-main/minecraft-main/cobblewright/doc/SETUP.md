# CobbleWright Setup Guide

Follow these steps to get your AI architect companion running in your Minecraft world.

## One-Click Installer (for Non-Developers)

If you have the `cobblewright.exe` file, the setup is much simpler.

1. **Install Ollama:** Download and install Ollama from ollama.com.
2. **Download AI Models:** Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following commands:

    ```bash
    ollama pull llama3.2:3b
    ollama pull llava
    ```

3. **Run CobbleWright:** Simply double-click the `cobblewright.exe` file to start the bot. Make sure Ollama is running in the background.
4. **Start Minecraft:** Launch Minecraft and open a world to LAN or join a server. CobbleWright will connect automatically.

## For Developers (Version Control)

If you plan to contribute to or modify the project, it's highly recommended to use Git for version control.

1. **Initialize Git:** In your project directory, run `git init`.
2. **Commit:** The included `.gitignore` file is configured to exclude dependencies, build files, and logs, ensuring a clean repository.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed:

1. **Minecraft: Java Edition:** The bot is designed for the Java version of Minecraft.
2. **Node.js:** Version 18.x or newer. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
3. **Ollama:** The platform for running the local AI model. Download it from [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai/).

## Installation and Setup

### Step 1: Install Ollama and Pull the AI Model

1. Install Ollama by following the instructions on their website.
2. Once installed, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to download the AI model. This may take a few minutes as the model is several gigabytes.

    ```bash
    ollama pull llama3.2:3b
    ollama pull llava
    ```

3. Leave the Ollama application running in the background.

### Step 2: Set Up the CobbleWright Project

1. Create a new folder for the project and navigate into it in your terminal.

    ```bash
    mkdir cobblewright
    cd cobblewright
    ```

2. Initialize a new Node.js project and install the required libraries.

    ```bash
    npm init -y # Creates package.json
    npm install mineflayer pg
    ```

    **Note:** If you have modified the `package.json` file to update dependencies (like `mineflayer`), run the following command to install the new versions:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Create a file named `config.json` in this folder and paste the configuration content into it.
    - To enable the text-to-speech feature, add `"USE_TTS": true` to this file.
    - To enable vision, you must add `"VISION_MODEL": "llava:latest"` and `"SCREENSHOTS_PATH": "C:/Users/YourUser/AppData/Roaming/.minecraft/screenshots"`.
    - For semantic long-term memory, set `"EMBEDDING_MODEL": "nomic-embed-text"` (or another Ollama embedding model available locally).
    - Memory retention controls are available with `"MEMORY_RETENTION_ENABLED"`, `"MEMORY_MAX_ENTRIES"`, and `"MEMORY_MAX_AGE_DAYS"`.
    - If you use a non-default embedding model, set `"EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS"` so pgvector indexes can be created with the correct vector width.
    - Gather structure protection controls are available with `"PROTECT_BUILDINGS_FOR_GATHERING"` and `"BUILDING_DETECTOR_RADIUS"`.
    - Night ghost mode is controlled with `"GHOST_MODE_AT_NIGHT"` and is enabled by default.
    - To enable long-term memory, add `"POSTGRES_URL": "postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/cobblewright"` (or set `DATABASE_URL` in your environment).
    - S.C semantic capsules are loaded automatically from `data/S.C/*.sc.json`.
    - The canonical grounding capsules are `minecraft_gameplay_core.sc.json` and `leighton_weight_core.sc.json`.
    - Plain `.json` knowledge files are only loaded when they are explicitly listed in `APPROVED_KNOWLEDGE_JSON` in `config.json`.
    - Runtime/state JSON artifacts under `data/` (for example ChronoSCRIBE state files) are ignored unless you explicitly approve them.
    - For NPC persona styling, place a voice/persona capsule in `data/S.C` (for example, `persona-voice.sc.json`).
    - Legacy fallback is still supported at `cobblewright-npc/persona.sc.json`.
    - **IMPORTANT:** You must replace `YourUser` with your actual Windows username.
4. Create a file named `architect.js` in this folder and copy the entire source code into it.

### Step 3: Run CobbleWright

This guide focuses on the most stable method: running a dedicated server on your machine.

#### 1. Set Up Your Minecraft Server

1. **Download the Server File:**
    - Open the Minecraft Launcher and go to the **"Installations"** tab.
    - Select your `1.21.1` installation and click the **"Server"** button to download the official `server.jar`.
    - Place this file in your server directory (for example, `MinecraftServer`).
2. **Configure Your Server (First-time setup only):**
    - Run your server's start script (for example, `start.bat`) once. It will close after creating new files.
    - **EULA:** The first time you run the server, it will create a `eula.txt` file. Open it and change `eula=false` to `eula=true`.
    - **Online Mode:** Open the `server.properties` file. Find the line `online-mode=true` and change it to `online-mode=false`. This allows the bot to connect.

#### 2. Start the Server and the Bot

1. **Start the Stack:** In a terminal, navigate to your `MinecraftServer` directory and run `\.\start.bat`.
2. **What the script does:** It starts PostgreSQL when Docker is available, launches the Minecraft server, waits for readiness, and then launches CobbleWright.
3. **Join the Game:** Launch Minecraft 1.21.1, go to **Multiplayer**, and connect to `localhost`.
4. **Optional manual bot start:** If you prefer to run the bot separately, open a new terminal in the `cobblewright` directory and run `node architect.js`.

You should see log messages in your terminal indicating that CobbleWright is connecting. Within a few seconds, you will see its welcome message in the Minecraft chat.

## Becoming a Server Operator (for Dedicated Servers)

To use in-game commands like `/gamemode`, `/effect`, `/weather`, or `/give` on your dedicated server, the relevant account must have operator status. In the console window where your server is running, type the following command, replacing `YourUsername` with your actual Minecraft username:

`op YourUsername`

If you want CobbleWright's night ghost mode to work, also grant operator status to the bot account:

`op CobbleWright`

## Performance Tuning (for Dedicated Servers)

If you see "Can't keep up!" warnings in your server console, it means the server is lagging. A quick win is to lower `view-distance` and `simulation-distance` in `server.properties` to `6`, reduce `entity-broadcast-range-percentage` to `75`, set `sync-chunk-writes=false`, and cap `max-chained-neighbor-updates` at `1000`. If you are using `/fill`, break large areas into smaller batches so you do not trigger huge block-update spikes.

You can also improve performance by using optimized Java startup flags. Open your `start.bat` file and replace the `java` command line with the following, which uses modern garbage collection settings:

```bat
"C:\Path\To\Your\java.exe" -Xmx4G -Xms4G -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+ParallelRefProcEnabled -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200 -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+DisableExplicitGC -XX:+AlwaysPreTouch -XX:G1NewSizePercent=30 -XX:G1MaxNewSizePercent=40 -XX:G1HeapRegionSize=8M -XX:G1ReservePercent=20 -XX:G1HeapWastePercent=5 -XX:G1MixedGCCountTarget=4 -XX:InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent=15 -XX:G1MixedGCLiveThresholdPercent=90 -XX:G1RSetUpdatingPauseTimePercent=5 -XX:SurvivorRatio=32 -XX:MaxTenuringThreshold=1 -Daikars.new.flags=true -jar server.jar nogui
```

Remember to adjust the path to your `java.exe` and the `-Xmx` value (for example, `-Xmx6G` for 6GB of RAM) to match your system.

## Troubleshooting

- **Connection Error:** If you see a connection error, double-check that your Minecraft world is open to LAN.
- **Ollama Error:** If you get an "Ollama error," ensure the Ollama application is running and that you have successfully pulled the model.
- **Bot Doesn't Speak:** If the bot joins but does not speak, wait about 90 seconds for the first automatic tip or type `build` in the chat to trigger it manually.
- **Chat Not Working:** If you can join the server but cannot send or see chat messages, you may need to adjust your Microsoft/Xbox account privacy settings. Sign in to your Microsoft account on the Xbox website and ensure that "You can communicate outside of Xbox with voice and text" and "Others can communicate with voice, text or invites" are set to "Allow" or "Everyone".
- **Bot Cannot Flee:** If you see warnings that the bot is in danger but has no home, stand where you want it to retreat and run `sethome` in chat.
- **NPM Installation Errors (ETARGET, notarget):** If you see errors about a "No matching version found" while running `npm install`, your dependency tree may be corrupted. To fix this, delete the `node_modules` folder and the `package-lock.json` file, then run `npm install` again.

    ```powershell
    # In your project directory
    rd /s /q node_modules
    del package-lock.json
    npm install
    ```

- **PostgreSQL Connection Errors:** If long-term memory fails to initialize, verify your PostgreSQL server is running and that `POSTGRES_URL` points to a reachable database/user/password. CobbleWright can now auto-create the configured database when the server is reachable but the database does not exist.

- **Ghost Mode Not Working:** If CobbleWright still takes damage during night patrol, verify that the bot account has permission to run `/gamemode` and `/effect`. Without those permissions, it falls back to normal flee behavior.

- **Patrol Keeps Asking For Coal:** If the bot cannot find coal for torches, it now defers torch crafting for a cooldown period and continues roaming instead of retrying every patrol tick.

    ```powershell
    # Press Ctrl+C to cancel the hanging install
    npm cache clean --force
    npm install onnxruntime-node --fetch-timeout=600000
    npm install
    ```

## Experimental: AI Skin Generation (MCSkinsGen)

This advanced method uses the **MCSkinsGen** project, a Stable Diffusion-based pipeline, to generate CobbleWright's skin from the design document.

### MCSkinsGen Prerequisites

- **Git:** Required to clone the research repository.
- **Python 3.10+** and **pip**.
- A dedicated Python virtual environment is highly recommended.
- A Hugging Face account and a "read" access token are required.

### Setup

1. **Clone the MCSkinsGen Repository:**
    Find a suitable location outside of the `cobblewright` project folder and clone the official repository.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RandomGamingDev/MCSkinsGen.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
    Navigate into the cloned directory and install the required Python packages.

    ```bash
    cd MCSkinsGen
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Configure CobbleWright:**
    Open `cobblewright-npc/config.json` and add the `experimental` section, pointing `MCSKINSGEN_PATH` to the location where you cloned the repository.

    ```json
      "experimental": {
        "MCSKINSGEN_PATH": "C:/path/to/your/MCSkinsGen"
      }
    ```

4. **Generate the Skin:**
    Navigate back to the `cobblewright-npc` directory and run the orchestrator script.

    ```bash
    cd C:/path/to/your/cobblewright/cobblewright-npc
    python generate_skin.py
    ```

This will invoke the pipeline. On the first run, you will be prompted to log in to Hugging Face with your access token. The script will then download the necessary models and generate the `skin.png` file.
