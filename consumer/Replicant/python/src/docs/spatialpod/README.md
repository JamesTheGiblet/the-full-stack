## What is SpatialPod?

SpatialPod is a revolutionary approach to spatial computing that treats digital spaces not as static containers, but as **living, breathing formations** that emerge from simple particle interactions.

Instead of forcing the physical world into an artificial grid of cubes or fixed geometries, SpatialPod lets you create **flexible, organic digital spaces** that naturally conform to how humans actually experience the world.

## Why "Pod"?

- **Seeds grow into pods** → Natural lifecycle
- **Pods protect what's inside** → Privacy & ownership  
- **Pods are portable** → Your space, anywhere
- **Pods are self-contained** → Independent but connectable

## Core Concepts

### 1. Spatial Particles
The fundamental building blocks of every pod:
- **Anchor Particles**: Define spatial structure
- **Content Particles**: Hold digital assets
- **Connection Particles**: Link related pods

### 2. Influence Fields
Each particle generates a field that decreases with distance. Multiple particles create overlapping fields that define the pod's boundary.

### 3. Emergent Boundaries
Rather than fixed shapes, boundaries emerge from where influence field strength crosses a threshold. Boundaries that:
- Conform to actual spaces
- Adapt to particle configuration
- Reshape dynamically

### 4. Energy Economy
Pods require energy to persist:
- **Sources**: Visits, content, engagement
- **Drains**: Time decay, complexity
- **Effects**: High energy = more influence

### 5. Content Self-Organization
Content particles find optimal positions through physics:
- Orbit pod center
- Repel other content
- Attract to relevant anchors
- Cluster by type/relationship

### 6. Pod Networks
Connections form naturally based on:
- Spatial proximity
- Content similarity
- User traversal patterns
- Shared themes

API Reference

Create a Pod

```javascript
const pod = new ForgePod(centerPosition, "My Pod");
pod.addContent('photo', imageData);
pod.addContent('audio', narration);
pod.addContent('ar_object', model3D);
```

Manage Energy

```javascript
pod.energy = 100; // Boost energy
pod.decayRate = 0.01; // 1% per frame
```

Form Networks

```javascript
const network = new PodNetwork("My Network");
network.addPod(pod1);
network.addPod(pod2);
network.calculateConnections();
```

Built on Forge Theory

SpatialPod demonstrates the Mavric Pattern - consistent three-layer architecture:

1. Foundation: Particles with basic properties
2. Interaction: Forces between particles
3. Emergence: Complex spatial experiences

This pattern appears throughout nature:

· Physics: Quarks → Atoms → Chemistry
· Biology: Cells → Tissues → Organisms
· Social: Individuals → Communities → Cultures
· SpatialPod: Particles → Fields → Experiences
